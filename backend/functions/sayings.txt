smells like teen spirit
get jiggy with it
Wisdom begins in wonder
Talent works genius creates
Nature is my medicine
Be curious not judgmental
Nothing succeeds like success
Faith can move mountains
He conquers who endures
Let life surprise you
Life teaches Love reveals
Think less live more
Make your life sweet
Donâ€™t just exist live
This too shall pass
Chaos makes the muse
Collect moments, not things
Rise by lifting others
Think less, feel more
Enjoy the little things
Dream big, pray bigger
Focus on the good
Be your own sunshine
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
Things will work out
you shall not pass
chill you got this
Happiness depends upon ourselves
Follow your own star
You only live once
don't worry be happy
All things must pass
